  <h2>Presumption</h2>
    <p>The following archive focuses on the manuscripts regarding the Women’s suffrage movement and how it took course across Pennsylvania. During this time, Philadelphia was the largest city within the largest state where women could not vote prior to the ratification of the 19th amendment in 1920. This amendment proclaims: "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex". Even before this and before the Seneca Falls Convention of 1848, Pennsylvania was a hotspot for all things surrounding women’s rights activism. Thisarchive’s collection dates back to 1914-1918, a time in history which was exceptionally closed minded towards women in the United States and across the world. Original photos, laws, flyers, lists, pamphlets, handbills, and written works are all contained within this collection. Each document within this archive holds something in common, they all promote the advancement of women’s rights during a time period when women in the United States could not even vote in political elections. The following manuscript dates back to 1915-1918, advocating against women’s rights through statements such  as “ You should VOTE AGAINST WOMAN SUFFRAGE for ten thousand reasons” and “You are not SORRY now, but if women are given the ballot you may REGRET it, when it’s too late”. This propaganda only made it more and more difficult for women to have a voice and stand up for themselves.

  <h2>Resolution</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this document is to advocate, persuade, and educate the society of the time. Mainly these archives revolve around topics concerning the issue of women’s voting rights. Taking into consideration that it was illegal for women to vote in the United States until 1920, these archives originate from years before that date. These archives all come from Pennsylvania and multiple examples come specifically from the city of Philadelphia. These various works provided support for women during a period in which they lacked assorted freedoms. They work in a sense of expressing women’s importance in deciding political ideals. Each document joins hand in hand with one other, they all express and prompt the same belief and opinion. These ideals were a way of thinking which was not considered common for the time being discussed. Since the internet and television had yet to exist, events such as marches were held in order to access and inform women to fight for their rights.</p>

<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Stratagem</h2>
    <p>Keeping in mind that women have the ability to vote, and have been able to do so since the year 1920, these documents most definitely hold power and are clearly significant in playing a role supporting the success of the Women’s Suffrage Movement. Over one hundred years later, women still fight for certain rights and respect. Documents, such as these, continue to exist today regarding different issues involving women’s legal rights. This in turn raises the question, will women of today, moving forward, create similar documents supporting additional laws to be put in place? If so, how will that go over, and will it show any success? At this point in time, with given technological advancements, how will advocacy works look different than the previously described women’s suffrage document archives?</p>
